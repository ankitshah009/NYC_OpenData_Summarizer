In so doing, we endeavor to provide our fellow veterans with the type of support they truly deserve. This outreach effort takes many forms, from the professional advice our service officers offer on earned veterans benefits to our legislative efforts on Capitol Hill to the work done by our hospital volunteers. Other AMVETS members involve themselves in a range of initiatives aimed at contributing to the quality of life in their local communities. \r\n\r\nThese two areas\u00e2\u20ac\u201dveterans service and community service\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddrive the commitment we have to make a difference in the lives of others. The pages of this website provide more detailed information on each area, as well as a wealth of information for veterans, their families and other interested citizens. Please take a few minutes to review what makes AMVETS the distinctive organization it is. Our aim of building for a better America is an undertaking to which all can contribute.",

The Law prohibits discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations based on race, color, creed, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, gender (including gender identity and sexual harassment), sexual orientation, disability, marital status, and partnership status. In addition, the Law affords protection against discrimination in employment based on arrest or conviction record and status as a victim of domestic violence, stalking and sex offenses. In housing, the Law affords additional protections based on lawful occupation, family status, and any lawful source of income. The City Human Rights Law also prohibits retaliation and bias-related harassment.",

        "description": "Who We Are: RCN is a 501 c (3) corporation, located in the Fordham section of the Bronx and with two sites in Harlem, NY.  Founded in 1996, by Executive Director Gail J. Davis, Round-The-Clock Nursery provides 24-hour/7 days-per-week childcare and was the first (and to this day), the only such institution in one of the most economically-disadvantaged communities in New York City. RCN is an educationally-focused, safe learning environment that enables parents with traditional or non-traditional work and/or educational schedules to pursue their goals. In addition, we provide emergency back-up services when parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regular childcare arrangements fail. \r\nRCN is accrdited by the NAEYC (National Association of the Education for Young Children) \r\nThe Need for RCN.  RCN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parent-centered\u00e2\u20ac\u009d child care services are urgently needed because existing child care services do not meet the needs of a significant segment of New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workforce. RCN was developed to address this service delivery gap. Our motto is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No matter the time, we help grow strong minds\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. \r\n\r\nRCN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mission Statement: Every child has the capacity to learn; every child has a right to a quality education; the learning process is a collaborative effort that requires the partnership of the child, the parent, and the educator and; children will excel academically in a nurturing, challenging, and interesting environment where their teachers have high expectations of them.",

        "description": "Day One is the only organization in New York City solely devoted to the issue of teen dating violence.  \r\n\r\nWorking alongside youth, Day One educates, organizes and advocates on behalf of young people at risk of or experiencing intimate partner violence.\r\n\r\nDay One focuses on young people because one in three teens experiences abuse in a dating relationship according to the United States Department of Justice. The most recent New York City Teen Health Risk Survey found that one in ten teenagers had experienced physical or sexual assault in a dating relationship within the previous year.\r\n\r\nIn each of our programs, Day One looks forward to new beginnings for youth. We engage young people in identifying methods of keeping themselves and their peers safe, and together envision a future without fear of abuse. Community involvement is critical to our ability to help young people. Please contact us to volunteer or make a contribution to support our services. \r\n\r\nOur Community Education Program offers interactive, law-based workshops that educate youth in public school classes, after-school programs and foster care group homes; we train social service providers, teachers and parents on domestic violence and the law. The Legal Services Program provides free and confidential information, advocacy and representation in family and criminal courts to youth between the ages of twelve and twenty-two. Day One conducts policy advocacy to increase rights for youth in local schools and the justice system. Through our Peer Leadership Program, we organize students and build leadership skills among college-aged youth. Students educate their peers, design education systems, develop materials, and perform outreach and advocacy. The Youth Voices Network is a group of survivors of relationship abuse, which channels the experiences of its members into building a safer future for other young people.  \r\n\r\nDay One is a project of the Fund for the City of New York.",

Through Children First, the Mayor and Chancellor sought to fundamentally transform the school system they inherited in 2002 when the State Legislature granted the Mayor control of the school system. They aimed to transform a system that had allowed generations of students to leave school without the skills and knowledge they needed to succeed, turning it into a system of 1,400-plus excellent schools, capable of helping the City\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds 1.1 million school children learn the skills and receive the support they deserve and need to succeed. Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Klein believe education reform requires a comprehensive and integrated plan, involving changes in strategy, leadership, management, people, and programming. Three inter-related principles are the driving forces behind the Children First reforms: leadership, empowerment, and accountability. Schools need strong leaders who are empowered to make decisions and who are accountable for results.",

We match female mentors with pregnant teens or teenage mothers who could benefit from an additional source of support and are open to a new friendship. Mentors have the opportunity to spend time with the teen moms and their children on outings focused on bonding and positive parenting and they also spend one on one time with the teen mom. \r\nThrough these matches, the teenage mothers increase their feeling of self-worth and learn to become more self-sufficient. Research shows that with additional support and motivation, young mothers can avoid further unwanted pregnancies and long-term dependence on welfare. 100% of the young mothers in our program showed measurable improvement in school performance, motivation and attendance after being matched for at least six months.\r\nProgram managers are available to refer participants to critical parenting-related services to address immediate fin",

        "description": "We oversee transportation and infrastructure projects that make transit within the Tri-state region more efficient.\u00c2\u00a0 To help improve the distribution of goods within and outside the five boroughs, NYCEDC manages the redevelopment of the City's rail freight lines, food markets, and maritime and aviation facilities. For companies seeking a new location, NYCEDC promotes the City's central business districts.\u00c2\u00a0 When appropriate, we sell or lease vacant City-owned property throughout the five boroughs, often in corporate and industrial parks.\u00c2\u00a0 We also encourage projects that strategically use underutilized property for economic development purposes. NYCEDC can support redevelopment projects by conducting planning and feasibility studies, performing financial analyses, guiding projects through necessary public approvals and packaging City programs and incentives. Our incentive programs can help eligible businesses meet their financing needs for property acquisition, new equipment, renovation, working capital and other purposes through the use of low-cost tax-exempt bonds.\u00c2\u00a0 Double and triple tax-exempt revenue bonds are issued by the New York City Industrial Development Agency, an entity administered by NYCEDC, for various types of organizations and transactions.",

        "description": "Spoons Across America, the source for children's culinary education is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to educating children, teachers, and families about the benefits of healthy eating. We work to influence the eating habits of children through hands-on education that celebrates the connection to local farmers and the important tradition of sharing meals around the family table. \r\n\r\nSpoons Across America is a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization founded on the premise that it is essential to the health of our children and our society to bring the joys of the table to the children of America. The table is where children learn about conversation, consideration, tolerance and other tools for getting along in society. When activities are centered around healthful food, children experience a fun and exciting way to learn about nutrition, the physiology of taste, and how food weaves its way through daily life, from the farm to the table. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur programs encourage healthy eating.\r\nHow? All of the program recipes use a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which are beneficial to long-term health and well-being.\r\n\r\nOur programs encourage family meals.\r\nHow? Whenever possible, Spoons Across America curricula involve in-class and homework assignments that initiate family meals, encourage family participation, and enrich the family eating experience.\r\n\r\nOur programs address the educational needs of children. How? Spoons Across America creates quality hands-on education programs that fulfill New York State educational standards and incorporates valuable life lessons.\r\n\r\nThe Spoons Across America programs include:\r\n1. Greenmarket Tour Guides\r\n2. NY Agricultural Literacy Day\r\n3. The Dinner Party Project\r\n4. AIWF NY/Days of Taste program",

A job provides a participant with much more than financial independence. It brings about fundamental and permanent changes including improvements in parenting, child development, housing, nutrition, health care and education (of parents and children). Moreover, these improvements greatly benefit the communities and regions where STRIVE graduates live by adding to consumer spending, increasing tax rolls and lowering public support. The accomplishment of these outcomes, pursued with the backing of funders having related objectives, will always be STRIVE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purpose.",

        "description": "The Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York (OCME)was established in 1918 pursuant to a 1915 Act of the New York State Legislature. In addition to being the first governmental agency of its type in the United States, OCME established the first toxicology laboratory in 1918 and the first serology laboratory in 1938, both at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. In 1933, New York University established the first Department of Forensic Medicine in the country. Since that date, Medical Examiners at OCME have held faculty positions in NYU's Forensic Medicine department. OCME's administrative offices were in the Municipal Building from 1918 to 1934, and at 125 Worth Street from 1934 to 1960; autopsies were performed at Bellevue Hospital and other borough municipal hospitals during those years. In 1960, OCME's six-story headquarters at 520 First Avenue (northeast corner of First Avenue and 30th Street) opened on land provided by New York University, adjacent to NYU Medical Center. In 1968 the Institute of Forensic Medicine of New York University and the City of New York was created; in 1977 the Institute was named after the late Milton Helpern, Chief Medical Examiner from 1954 to 1973. The Institute is comprised of OCME, the New York University School of Medicine, and the New York University College of Dentistry. OCME's headquarters at 520 First Avenue houses executive offices, the mortuary, autopsy rooms, X-Ray/photography facilities, as well as toxicology and histology laboratories. In February 2007, OCME opened the OCME DNA Building located at 421 East 26 Street (east of First Avenue), which houses state of the art Forensic Biology laboratories, as well as OCME\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Administrative unit and Evidence facilities including a forensic garage to examine vehicles for forensic evidence.",

        "description": "Graham Windham helps under-served children overcome obstacles on the\r\npath to self-sufficiency by giving them the skills to succeed, supporting\r\nand strengthening their families and, when necessary, supplementing their families.\r\n\r\nThe programs operated by Graham Windham are inspired by one single steadfast vision of a city where children are protected from pain and suffering and are free to mature in safe and loving homes. All of our pioneering initiatives over our 200 years of uninterrupted service to New York's neediest children and families grow out of a commitment to making this vision real for the thousands of citizens we serve each year.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that the children we serve today face an array of challenges and difficulties - often dire - that will jeopardize their ability to survive, grow and prosper if left unaddressed. First and foremost, they need safe and caring homes, followed by professional assistance to help them with their problems and real opportunities to learn and develop and to expand their horizons. Today's Graham Windham continues to experiment, innovate and expand its broad spectrum of multidisciplinary services to include whatever it takes to enable children and their families to triumph over conditions that put their chances for learning, growing and staying together at risk.\r\n\r\nNowhere is the barrier to success and wellbeing more apparent than in the area of education and literacy. Education is still the best ticket out of poverty and limited opportunity and the children we server all too often get the least our American educational system has to offer. Fully understanding the crushing nature of this disadvantage, Graham Windham has added educational supports and literacy enhancements to every one of its programs up and down the continuum of care. Ensuring that all our children have the tools and assistance needed to master their potential has become our signature goal.\r\n\r\nThroughout its proud 200 year history, Graham Windham has been on the front lines of child welfare policy and practice. We take a back seat to no one when it comes to the health and welfare of the children and families we serve. This remains true today and will remain true tomorrow. We are committed to continued quality improvement - for our children and families, their home communities and for this distinguished and historic child welfare agency.",

It hears misdemeanor and summons cases and combines punishment with help to deter future offending.

        "description": "Protecting and promoting our industrial sector is crucial to the city's overall economic development. In January 2005, Mayor Bloomberg created the Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses to retain and grow the sector's job base, execute the goals of the industrial policy, and serve as a single point of coordination for the industrial and manufacturing sector. The sector provides close to 500,000 jobs in New York City, making up nearly 15% of the city's workforce, and contributed $1.7 billion in tax revenues in 2004. The manufacturing and industrial sector is not only a strong component of our economy but a reliable source of jobs for many of our fellow New Yorkers. More than half of the employees in the industrial sector have a high school diploma or less and nearly a fifth have limited English proficiency. New York City is a strategic location to operate an industrial business. The unparalleled concentration of residents, businesses, economic activity, and wealth creates a tremendous end market for the industrial sector. Every employer praises the New York City workforce for its unparalleled diversity, depth of talent, commitment, and proactive attitude. Despite these advantages, challenges remain for the sector. Space to expand or relocate is expensive and scarce, operating costs are high, and there is a perception that the overall business environment presents obstacles. Our Office has begun to address these issues. Our Office broadened the Commercial Expansion Program to create benefits especially for industrial and manufacturing businesses that rent their spaces. In early 2006 our Office created 16 Industrial Business Zones across the City where expanded business services are available for industrial and manufacturing businesses. A relocation tax credit of $1,000 per employee is offered for manufacturing and industrial businesses that choose to relocate within the Industrial Business Zones.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Moreover, the zones represent areas where the Bloomberg Administration guarantees it will prohibit any new residential development. And State tax credits are also available to qualified businesses located in certain Industrial Business Zones as a result of the recent reconfiguration of the New York City's Empire Zones. Our Office intends to see these initiatives grow and better serve the city\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds industrial and manufacturing businesses. We encourage you to explore this site to learn more. Please contact us to let us know how we can help you.",

This innovative program enables victims to meet with a prosecutor, speak with a trained counselor, and apply for housing and financial assistance in just one visit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all in their native language while their children play safely in the next room.  By providing services in one location with partnering City agencies and community providers, the Brooklyn and Queens Centers are increasing the effectiveness of service delivery to break the cycle of violence.

Since 1979, the Storefront has provided direct service to the community. The Storefront offers support services and neighborhood organizing for the community. Many Storefront staff members are community residents. \r\n\r\nBridgebuilder Initiative to Improve Child Welfare for Highbridge \r\nBridgebuilder Initiative to Improve Child Welfare for Highbridge is a coalition of parents, community leaders and professionals, schools and other social service agencies that provide needed services to the community so that families can be healthy and children can stay safely in their homes. The Family Support Program, part of the Bridgebuilder Initiative, outreaches to the Highbridge Community to engage parents and provide them with services such as education, legal services, supportive counseling, case management, eligibility assistance and advocacy, advocacy in Family Court, and counseling. Child Welfare Organizing Project (CWOP) is a partner organization that aims to train and advocate for parent's rights in the child welfare system.  \r\n \r\nThe Community Collaborative to Improve Bronx Schools (CCB, formerly CC9) \r\nThe Community Collaborative to Improve Bronx Schools (CCB, formerly CC9) is a coalition of six community-based organizations and the NYU Institute for Education and Social Policy. This parent-led collaboration for educational justice is the first community organization to be publicly recognized for its work in improving student achievement in District 9 Schools. The United Parents of Highbridge, formed by parents of children who participate in our youth programs, and other parent groups have successfully brought together the Department of Education and the United Federation of Teachers to implement the first Lead Teacher program in NYC. CCB is leading a major campaign to improve traffic safety near schools.  \r\n \r\n \r\nThe Highbridge Horizon \r\nThe Highbridge Horizon is a bilingual community advocacy newspaper produced by and for the residents of southern Highbridge. The mission of the publication is twofold: to galvanize residents to create positive, lasting neighborhood change; and to provide a forum for residents -- especially youth -- to learn and develop viable communication skills.  \r\n \r\nHomeless Outreach \r\nHomeless Outreach provides mobile meals and services to those residents who are homeless.",

        "description": "The New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG) is a nonprofit organization that offers vulnerable New Yorkers the legal help they critically need. NYLAG?s mission is to provide free, civil legal services to poor and near poor individuals and families residing in the five boroughs of New York City who would otherwise be unable to access legal assistance. Since 1990, NYLAG has been dedicated to providing legal services to underserved, impoverished populations through direct representation, impact and class action litigation, consultation and community education. As a city-wide multi-legal services agency, NYLAG has the capacity to fill a vital gap in legal assistance to a wide range of low income populations including victims of domestic violence, immigrants, the elderly, the chronically ill, children with special needs, Holocaust survivors, and many other less fortunate members of society.",

Through a range of supports and services, SAYA! provides South Asian youth, ages 11 to 19, with safe spaces to learn, grow, play, and contribute to their communities-and each other. \r\n\r\nEach year, more than 400 young people-with roots in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Guyana, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Trinidad-take part in SAYA!'s center- and school-based programs. Among the services provided by SAYA! are academic and career preparation, recreational and artistic opportunities, individual and group counseling, and leadership and organizing activities. Through its programs and advocacy efforts, SAYA! works to create broad social and systemic changes that positively impact immigrant youth.",

        "description": "The Business Outreach Center (BOC) Network is a micro-enterprise/small business development organization with over a decade-long record of delivering customized business services to under-served entrepreneurs in New York City and, more recently, in Newark, New Jersey, as well as capacity-building services to organizations establishing and operating community and micro-enterprise development programs.\r\n\r\nInnovative and collaborative, the BOC Network works to close the credit and technical-assistance gap limiting the growth potential and job-creation capacities of microentrepreneurs and small businesses of hard-working men and women who operate in isolation from the mainstream market and whose businesses are an important source of jobs in their largely minority and immigrant communities. By stimulating the growth of profitable enterprises, the BOC Network helps to recirculate capital through neighborhood economies, and so to revitalize whole communities.\r\n\r\nIndividually and in concert, the BOC Network's growing alliance of Business Outreach Centers, or BOCs, connect local entrepreneurs to the full complement of business assistance services, as well as to financial, legal, and other resources. In the process, they successfully guide them through the process of starting and developing their enterprises, and then follow-up with them as they progress and their needs evolve.\r\n\r\nSpeaking the languages of the communities they serve, individual BOCs have proven to be ideally suited to reach and extend a guiding hand to local entrepreneurs whose challenges are many and resources few. BOC business counselors provide one-on-one needs assessment, business planning, marketing and management guidance, as well as access to resources through the BOC Network's extensive linkages with the full spectrum of public and private business assistance sources.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the BOC Network serves as a highly interactive forum for sharing technology and resources across community and cultural lines, enabling local entrepreneurs to familiarize themselves with the latest business practices, to forge meaningful links with mainstream services, markets, and mentors, and to gain access to new business-development opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the BOC Network makes connections that make the system work for local entrepreneurs, communities, regions, service providers, and the economy as a whole.",

The Legal Aid Society is an indispensable component of the legal, social, and economic fabric of New York City-- passionately advocating for individuals across a variety of civil, criminal and juvenile rights matters, while also fighting for legal reform.  The Legal Aid Society has performed this role in the city, state and federal courts for over 130 years.  It does so by capitalizing on the diverse expertise, experience and capabilities of 850 of the brightest legal minds.  It works with 600 social workers, investigators, paralegals, and support and administrative staff in every borough of the city.  It takes on more cases for more clients than any other organization in New York City.  And it brings a depth and breadth of perspective that is unmatched in the legal profession.  The Legal Aid Society at the vanguard of the cause of equal justice under law for all people. Its unique value is an ability to go beyond any one case to create more equitable outcomes for individuals and broader, more powerful systemic change for society as a whole.  The Legal Aid Society operates through a network of borough, neighbohood and courthouse offices in 25 locations in New York City and provides comprehensive legal services in all five boroughs free of charge for clients who cannot afford to pay for counsel.  In addition to the three major practices: Civil, Criminal and Juvenile Rights, The Legal Aid Society receives volunteer help from law firms and corporate law departments that is coordinated by the Pro Bono Practice.  The Legal Aid Society handles more than 295,000 cases and legal matters for clients each year. The Civil Practice handles more than 30,000 client matters providing assistance to the most vulnerable New Yorkers, including senior citizens, chronically ill or disabled children and adults, survivors of domestic violence, immigrants, low-wage or unemployed workers, persons living with HIV/AIDS, and homeless or imminently homeless children and adults.   The Criminal Practice, the primary provider of indigent defense services in New York City, is comprised of trial offices in the four major boroughs, an Appeals Bureau, a Parole Revocvation Defense Unit, an Adolescent Intervention and Diversion Unit and a MICA Unit for mentally ill, chemically addicted clients. The Criminal Practice handles a total of 235,000 cases. The Juvenile Rights Practice's core client service is the representation of children in Family Court in abuse and neglect cases, juvenile delinquency matters, and persons in need of supervision.

        "description": "The SAVI Program provides Emergency Room Crisis Intervention for survivors of rape, sexual assault, incest and domestic violence delivered by highly trained volunteer Advocates. Our Advocates respond to cases in 6 emergency departments in Manhattan and 5 emergency departments in Queens. We currently have 250 active volunteers. We recruit and train about 100 new volunteers each fall.\r\n\r\nOutside of the emergency departments, SAVI provides group and individual counseling - short-term and long-term ?  for survivors of rape, sexual assault, domestic violence and incest. (Manhattan and Queens - counseling for adults, children and teens.) \r\n\r\nIn addition to working in the emergency departments and providing counseling services for survivors and co-survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence, SAVI also provides outreach and training services to the Manhattan and Queens communities. SAVI speakers present at schools, community and business groups, street fairs, health fairs and other venues to provide public education and outreach.  Professional sensitivity training is also provided to medical, law enforcement, criminal justice and social service personnel as well as primary prevention sessions. \r\n\r\nOur mission is three-fold:  (1) to meet the needs of sexual assault and domestic violence survivors by offering immediate crisis intervention in hospital emergency rooms,  (2) to follow up with counseling and information both for survivors and for their significant others and friends, as well as for those who seek help relating to incidents of rape, sexual assault, incest or domestic violence in the past, and (3) to educate the public and professional communities regarding services and issues surrounding rape, sexual assault and domestic violence.   All services and outreach activities are provided in both Manhattan and Queens and are confidential and free of charge and available to all without regard to gender, race, economic status or religious or ethnic group.",

Now entering its fourth decade under the leadership of Julie Crosby, countless artists have achieved significant recognition through WP productions, including Anne Bogart, Eve Ensler, Lynn Nottage, Maria Irene Fornes, Rinne Groff, Suzan-Lori Parks, Naomi Wallace, and Anna Deavere Smith, among the many. During its 31 years, WP has staged over 600 mainstage productions and developmental projects, and published ten anthologies of plays. Women's Project mentors talented artists through its free, intensive Directors, Playwrights, and Producers Labs, and reaches over 2,000 students annually through Ten Centuries of Women Playwrights, an award-winning arts education program. In 1998, Women?s Project purchased a historic off-Broadway venue christened the Julia Miles Theater in 2004 on Manhattan's West 55th Street, making WP the first and only women's theater company to hold the keys to its own stage.",

        "description": "Community Health Action is the only Staten Island community-based organization dedicated to providing HIV/AIDS education, prevention and services to borough residents and providers. For people living with HIV and AIDS, we offer comprehensive case management, including specialized services for undocumented immigrants, the mentally ill, children and pregnant women, and prison inmates. Our Community Re-entry Program connects with positive men released to New York City from upstate prisons, escorts them to appointments and offers counseling to encourage healthy choices and reduce recidivism.\r\nWe provide treatment adherence education, a specialized food pantry, holiday food basket deliveries and social and recreational activities such as an annual holiday party and a bi-monthly dinner with an educational presentation and children's activities.\r\nWe provide free, confidential rapid HIV counseling and testing at three storefronts, on a Mobile Health Unit, at the College of Staten Island and at Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, and at community venues on request. Clients confirmed positive are offered case management intakes and connected to medical appointments and health insurance.\r\nSince opening our doors in 1989, we have expanded to serve other communities historically impacted by HIV/AIDS. We have developed health educational and social programs for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) communities. In 2008 we opened a dedicated LGBT Center, the only one in the borough. We operate a community food pantry and offer benefits counseling and vocational readiness services. Through partnerships with the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene, we offer smoking cessation counseling, Nicotine Replacement Therapy, Hepatitis C screening and Hepatitis A and B vaccinations. Injection drug users are offered clean syringes through a Syringe Exchange Program (SEP) and the NYS Expanded Syringe Access Program (ESAP), education on safe injection techniques, overdose prevention and prescriptions for Narcan, and referral to a new treatment for opiate addiction, Suboxone. Mental health counseling and support groups are provided for people with substance use histories and for LGBT and questioning youth and adults.  An OASAS-funded, medically-supervised outpatient treatment program helps active substance users, and there are specific addiction treatment services for families with children and for recent prison releasees and parolees.\r\nFor youth ages 13 to 24, we offer testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy testing and referral for follow-up services. At our three storefronts and on the mobile unit we provide free male and female condoms, lubricant, dental dams, finger cots and sexual risk reduction education. Youth peer educators conduct street outreach and staff resource tables at health fairs and community events.  Staff offer youth-focused workshops at schools and community groups.",

In recent decades, the YWCA has evolved to meet the varying challenges faced by women and girls of all ages, including racial disparities in health outcomes.  In July 2005, the YWCA announced a major restructuring of its programs and renovation of its facilities to better align its core services with its mission. In January 2009 we completed 84  new studio apartments for low income people.",

Additionally, CASW bears the distinction of conducting the neighborhood's only year-round, after-school and weekend training workshops in dance, music, art, science and martial arts.  CASW strives to reach those youth with fragile family support systems; the vast majority of whom are recently arrived immigrants.  We also provide strong academic support for those who are at-risk of dropping out of school through our after-school tutoring and basic skills instruction.  Through numerous activities that build self-reliance and conflict resolution skills, youth are taught to cope with the negative influences that confront them on a daily basis.   Our programs and services provide a holistic approach to the needs of youth and their families.  All participants receive an in depth interview to help us assess their needs and determine if they need to be referred to other social service agencies that would better address their particular need(s) or problem(s).",

        "description": "Dominican Foundation CULTURARTE of New York \r\n\r\nThe Power of Culture is of everyone \r\n\r\nHistory \r\n\r\nThe Dominican Foundation Culturarte of New York was founded in June 20th, 2001 under the guidance of Dr. Jorge Pi,a psychotherapist and poet and with visual artist and poet, Karina Rieke. The organization believes that participation and education in the arts helps create mature, emotionally and intellectually well-rounded individuals. \r\n\r\nThe Center's School of the Arts offers weekly classes and seminars on music, dance, theater, painting, film, photography, poetry, creative writing, journalism and literature. Through participation in classes and performance groups, students learn discipline and healthy self-expression. Our students, adults and young people, use the skills and talents developed in arts training as an artistic alternative to the prevention of violence, drug abuse, low-educational attainment levels, poverty and other issues that plague our community. Culturarte's goal is to create a well-educated, healthy, and creative community. \r\n\r\nLocated in the heart of Washington Heights, Culturarte serves members of the over 400,000-immigrant community from South and Central America and the Caribbean. Providing artistic educational services keeps participants in touch with their heritage, while acting as a bridge to the culture and environment of the United States and New York City. For first-and second-generation members of the community, the ills of the inner-city often supplant the values of their native culture. \r\n\r\n\r\nMission Statement \r\n\r\nTo promote and preserve the Hispanic and Afro-Caribbean heritage through the arts \r\nTo create a multicultural, multidisciplinary arts center for the development of talent and tolerance \r\nTo use the arts to administer to the social concerns and problems of the Hispanic community",

We give vulnerable youth in New York City the opportunity to take ownership of their future, making a difference today and for the next generation. \r\n\r\nFocusing on high-need communities in Brooklyn and the Bronx, we provide a broad array of individual, family and school-based services to prevent youth from becoming disconnected from family, school and society. We also help those who come to us already disengaged find hope and motivation to reconnect with their community. When young people cannot stay in their families, we continue to provide a safety net of superior quality foster care and residential programs, as we have since 1857. \r\n\r\nGood Shepherd's programs succeed because of the unique way in which we work:\r\n\r\nWe have a profound belief in the strengths inherent in youth and the ability of individuals and families to transform themselves;\r\n\r\nWe surround youth and families with the services and supports they need;\r\n\r\nWe employ a rigorous business approach that stresses partnerships and makes the very most of both public and private resources.",

To meet the needs of this rapidly growing population, BCA has developed a full array of bilingual and culturally sensitive services and programs.  BCA's services include four senior centers, bilingual social services, adult education programs, early childhood education programs, youth services, community economic development projects, crime prevention and victims services, naturalization assistance services, and newspaper publication.  Also, to promote cultural understanding and harmony in the neighborhood, BCA has been sponsoring community events such as the Annual Chinese New Year Parade and Annual Clean Up Day. Currently, with its Main Community Service Center and eighteen other service sites in Sunset Park, Borough Park, Bay Ridge, Sheepshead Bay, and Bensonhurst, BCA serves over 2,300 individuals on a daily basis.",

        "description": "The East Harlem Neighborhood Based Alliance Corporation (EHNBAC) is a non-profit organization established on March 3rd 1993, as part of a State-wide initiative implemented under the New York State Neighborhood Based Alliance (NBA) laws of 1990.   The objectives of this State-wide initiative was: 1) through the operation of a crisis intervention center, to stabilize volatile situations for families and individuals in crisis situations or to address situations that if left unaddressed could become crisis, and 2) to improve long-term economic and social conditions through the development and implementation of a Strategic Neighborhood Action Plan (SNAP).  \r\n\r\nSince 1993, over 2,000 individuals and families have been placed in decent, affordable apartments, over 4,000 families have averted homelessness, over 2,000 families have avoided serious injury or death, have been placed in safe houses, and have secured monetary compensation and over 1,000 individuals have received HIV/AIDS services.\r\n\r\nAlthough the EHNBAC downscaled its operation after NYS Neighborhood Based Alliance Initiative sunset in 1996 it continues to serve approximately 600 individuals and families per year.  Most staff are bilingual in Spanish and English.  \r\n\r\nThe EHNBAC provides crime victims with legal advocacy, family court advocacy around divorce, child visitation, child support, orders of protection.  We accompany participants to precincts, court, and the District Attorney?s Office.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Assistance for Victims\r\nWe provide emergency services such as the changing of locks, purchase of furniture, clothing, pampers, food and payment of legal and documentation fees to regain lost or missing identification and legal documents, relocation assistance, and rent assistance if the victim is at risk of eviction.  \r\n\r\nWe provide advocacy to obtain repairs, initiation of overcharge claims, tenant landlord mediation, money management training, legal advocacy, and assistance in securing and maintaining entitlements and benefits.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2005, in response to the high rates of HIV/AIDS in East Harlem, the EHNBAC instituted its HIV/AIDS education program known as Awareness Can Change Every Persons Tomorrow (ACCEPT).  Since then, over 900 individuals have received education and services focusing on the prevention of HIV/AIDS.  The EHNBAC ACCEPT program provides case management, crisis intervention services, prevention workshops, individual and family counseling sessions, referrals to treatment at local hospitals and medical centers in the community, information and referral,  permanency planning and condom distribution. \r\n \r\nIts Homelessness Prevention Program aims to prevent eviction through Housing Court representation, tenant/landlord mediation and emergency cash assistance paid directly to landlords or utility providers.  \r\n\r\nIf relocation is the appropriate alternative, the EHNBAC will secure alternative housing placement for families where eviction cannot be avoided.",

We seek out those cut off from effective help, and we connect them to housing and to communities. We expand the supply of affordable, supportive housing.  We improve the well-being of our tenants and clients by providing access to stable housing, effective health care and behavioral services, and programs that support a healthier, economically independent lifestyle.  We continue to apply lessons learned, to adapt our techniques, and to share the best approaches for accomplishing these goals.\r\n\r\nTo date, Common Ground has created more than 2,000 units of affordable permanent and transitional housing in New York City, Connecticut, and upstate New York; we currently manage more than 1,600 units.  We are developing eight properties that comprise 1,375 units toward our goal of creating 4,000 additional units of housing for the homeless by 2015.",

Bragg army wife and a 19-year survivor of domestic violence.  After the loss of my  infant twin daughter to a domestic violence assault and beginning my journey to healing, my mission has been to bring this social disease out of the closet through public speaking and various community awareness projects.",

It is the outgrowth of a grassroots community response to medical abandonment of the area.  Founded by the Morris Heights Neighborhood Improvement Association with a small federal grant, MHHC has grown to meet the continuing needs of the community.  \r\n\r\nOUR SERVICES\r\n* Primary Care Services\r\nPediatrics \r\nAdolescent Services\r\nFamily Planning\r\nInternal Medicine\r\nObstetrics/Gynecology\r\nLabor and Delivery\r\nSchool Health Program\t\r\nDentistry\r\nHIV Counseling, Testing & Treatment\r\n\r\n* Specialty Care Services\r\nAsthma/Allergy\r\nRadiology/Ultrasound\r\nLaboratory\r\nColposcopy\r\nSonography\r\nPodiatry\r\nGastroenterology\r\nNutrition Counseling\r\nWIC\r\nCOBRA/Case Management\r\nOptometry/Ophthalmology\r\n\r\n* Counseling Center\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nPsychiatry\r\nIndividual & Family Counseling\r\nSupport Groups\r\n\r\n*Education\r\nLamaze, Parenting and Breastfeeding Classes\tPCAP (Prenatal Care Assistance Program)\r\nPeer Education\r\nCommunity Outreach/Marketing\r\nResidency Training\r\n\t\t\r\n*Insurance Support/Facilitated Enrollment Services\r\nCHIP (Child Health Insurance Program)\r\nMedicaid\r\nFHP (Family Health Plan)\r\n\r\nMorris Heights Health Center was the first federally-funded community health center in New York City to be accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) in 1983.

        "description": "Social Security Retirement, Disability and Survivors Insurance programs are federal insurance programs for workers administered by the Social Security Administration.  Enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act originally was a retirement program intended to provide financial support for elderly workers who coould no longer perform gainful labor.  In more than half a century since its enactment, coverage has been added for other groups of workers.  Social  Security also administers a needs based program called Supplemental Security Income(SSI) for those who do not have sufficient coverage to entitle them to Social Security benefits and who meet certain income and resource limits. \r\nNearly 60 percent of the people receiving Social Security benefits are women.  In the 21st century, more women work, pay Social security taxes and earn credit toward their own monthly retirement income than in any other time in our nation's history. Women tend to care for many people including spouses, children and parents.  Women are more likely to earn less over their lifetimes than men.  Women are less often covered by private retirement plans and more dependent on Social Security- and for a longer period of time since, on average, women live about five years longer than men. When women work, they pay taxes into the Social Security system, providing their own benefits. Women who do not work are often covered through their husbands' work and can receive benefits based on their current husband or prior husband's work record when they retire, become disabled or die. Women should remember to contact Social Security to correct the information Social Security has for them, if they change their name through divorce or marriage\r\nFor information on benefits, entitlement, and eligibility go to www.socialsecurity.gov/women. The web site has a specific section devoted to women's issues. At age 65, most women will be eligible for Medicare Par A if they are eligible for benefits on their own record or on their husband's record.  Women will have the opportunity to buy Medicare medical insurance (Part B) for a monthly premium.  If they are not eligible for a benefit because they do not have enough credits, they can purchase Medicare coverage by paying a monthly premium.  For more information, go to  www.Medicare.gov or call the toll-free Medicare information number at 1-800-633-4227. For more Social Security information visit our web site at www.socialsecurity.gov.  If you do not have access to a computer, we have a toll free number at 1-800-772-1213 with representatives available from 7am to 7pm Monday through Friday.

We hold parenting skills training and group discussions to help parents understand child development and to acquire skills that will help them improve their family relationships. Youth 3) Youth Project. Facilitates the creation of a space where youth can develop skills that will allow them to make collective contributions to their community, as well as providing them with opportunities for their own personal development. Our mission is based on the philosophy of elevating social consciousness to empower people through community organizing. In each project people find opportunities to achieve their potentials and the motivation to fight for their rights. This is achieved by collective learning, collaboration, and direct action.",

        "description": "Voces Latinas (VL) started it's work in 2003 as part of the Western Queens HIV Care Network. A group of certified social workers in the HIV field who were also part of the Network were concerned about the high rates of HIV among women of color, particularly immigrant Latinas, as there exists a gap in services for this hard to reach population due to immigration status, documentation status, language barrier, and cultural norms. Voces Latinas saw a need for more outreach, education, advocacy and resources in Spanish for this population. VL began raising money in order to hold conferences and forums in Queens targeting immigrant Latinas living with and at risk for HIV. This was an opportunity to invite the HIV specialist to come to Queens and talk to the population at hand, as it is often impossible for these women to attend conferences often times held in English and in other parts of the country. The response to the conferences and forums was so positive that Voces Latinas began holding bi-monthly community workshops around issues placing Latinas at high risk for HIV/AIDS such as domestic violence, alcohol and substance abuse, depression, etc. These workshops quickly turned weekly. The workshops continue to be held weekly and also serve to provide an opportunity for Latinas to meet and provide each other emotional support and an opportunity to tell their stories, which for many of them is the first time ever openly talking about their lives.",

        "description": "The EHTP participants engage in a variety of inter-related activities, all of which are focused on literacy and operate within a youth development framework. These activities include:\r\nHomework Help: This service is available daily for all participants, K-12, over-aged and under-credited participants. \r\nSmall-group Study with Academic Specialists: Our certified teachers provide targeted support in reading, writing, math, science and global studies. We also provide remedial work for those who have begun college in the area and have requested our help. \r\nArts and Culture Activities: These comprise dance, drama and poetry, photography, video/filmmaking and music recording. Middle- and high-school participants are recruited by FUEGO en la 106, our resident dance company, where they discover the world of dancing while learning about different cultures, the rigors of performing, teamwork and self-discipline. \r\nCreative Writing and Reading: By keeping weekly journals, participating in book clubs, engaging in scriptwriting and carrying out interviews, among other things, participants can learn new and interesting ways to express themselves on the page. \r\nTechnology Access and Education: These activities promote computer, web-design and networking skills as well as general computer literacy. \r\nScience and Innovation: Featuring our award-winning FIRST Robotics Team (which, despite being East Harlem's first robotics team ever, managed to beat proven powerhouses like Stuyvesant HS and Bronx HS of Science to Nationals) and its middle school component, Lego Robotics. We are pleased to have just been included in the InvenTeam competition out of MIT. \r\nCollege and Career Preparation: We offer test prep, college tours, career exploration, SAT prep and Regents prep. \r\nYouth Development Activities: These provide young participants with much needed skills in conflict resolution, community activism, volunteering, youth governance, teamwork, time management and decision making. \r\nOne-to-One Tutoring: Personalized tutoring remains a mainstay of our programming with weekly sessions, 11/2 hours per week. \r\nRecreation and Sports: These activities include basketball, table tennis and supervised park visits. \r\nFamily Literacy Programming: Springing from a direct need voiced by the parents themselves, this service began this year with our first-ever ESL classes. We were thrilled to have advanced 26 parents from the first session. \r\nUniversity Program: EHTP's University Program offers high-school students the opportunity to work with licensed teachers so that they can prepare for Regent exams and improve their chances to accumulate credits. Working hand in hand with staff members, they will identify college or career options and fulfill the necessary requirements to become competitive applicants for their school or career of choice. EHTP-UP also provides an off-site \"boot camp\" for 30 rising high-school freshmen and sophomores.",

        "description": "For over 35 years Advocates for Children of New York, Inc. (AFC) has worked in partnership with New York City's most impoverished and vulnerable families to secure quality and equal public education services. AFC works on behalf of children from infancy to age 21 who are at greatest risk for school-based discrimination and/or academic failure. These include children with disabilities, ethnic minorities, immigrants, homeless children, foster care children, limited English proficient children and those living in poverty. AFC provides a full range of services: free individual case advocacy, technical assistance, and training for parents, students, and professionals about children's educational entitlements and due process rights in New York City. \r\n\r\nAFC's outreach educates and empowers its clients to challenge unfair and exclusionary school-based systems, policies and practices. AFC's work on institutional reform aims to engage key public policy making entities in strategies to modify existing educational legal structures, procedures and regulations which negatively impact on young people's academic success. AFC's efforts are strengthened by ongoing policy analysis focused on the institutionalization of inclusionary, effective, and equitable school practices. \r\n\r\nBy effectively combining legal services (from advice to administrative and court representation), impact litigation, individual case representation, public education, training, organizing, and in-depth research and policy analysis, AFC has been a powerful engine for change on behalf of children in New York.",

Initially, CPC volunteers counseled families referred by local schools, and provided case management services to help immigrants adjust to their new homes. Filling a void in the community as the first social service agency to serve Chinese-Americans in New York, CPC began to expand its services based on the needs expressed by those in the community.",

Feminist additions to your Passover seder and a new prayerbook for everyday. Role models you've never met before. Foremothers. Jewish hair (YES!). What's different about Jewish women's attitudes to food. Reviews of books, plays, films, music and videos. The best new poetry and fiction.

        "description": "Dwa Fanm (meaning \"Women's Rights\" in Haitian) started as a volunteer-run community-based organization in 1999 when a group of eight Haitian and American women from diverse backgrounds met to discuss the state of women's rights in Haitian immigrant communities in the United States and in Haiti. Having established itself as a human rights organization, Dwa Fanm's mission is to empower all women and girls with the freedom to define and control their own lives. Through service, education, advocacy and grassroots programs, Dwa Fanm works to end discrimination, violence, and other forms of injustice in New York City and abroad. \r\nDwa Fanm's members share a commitment to women's rights as well as to social and legal equality, justice, peace and democracy. We envision a world where women fully and equally participate in processes that favor their well-being and economic independence, where they have the freedom to define their lives and where all girls can develop to their full potential.\r\n\r\nWe oppose all forms of discrimination and exclusion due to sex, age, color, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, martial or parental status, physical ability, social class and economic status.\r\n\r\nWe support the right of women to fight exploitation and poverty. We believe women have the right to control their own bodies. We support a woman's right to have children and to not have children, to resist and denounce rape and incest, to marry whom they want to or not to marry. All women have value independent of their relationship to a man and deserve the respect of society. These values represent what many of us define as feminism.",

Desi is a common term used by people of South Asian descent to identify as people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and parts of the diaspora including Africa, England, Fiji, Guyana, and Trinidad.  DRUM was founded in early 2000 to build power of South Asian low wage immigrant workers, families fighting deportation, and youth in New York City. We organize through political education and membership led action for immigrant rights, racial, economic, and social justice.\r\n\r\nDRUM builds the power of our members, particularly youth and women, to win full civil and economic rights for immigrants, including legalization and an end to deportation policies.  \r\n\r\nOur long-term vision is to build the power of immigrant workers in the U.S in unity with all low-wage workers and communities of color to win rights and dignity. We see our movements for justice in the U.S. rooted in working in solidarity with people of the Global South for just global trade, economic, and foreign policies.",

        "description": "Crown Heights Jewish Community Council (CHJCC) is a private, nonprofit social service agency serving one of the most diverse and challenging neighborhoods in New York City. The agency was formed in 1969 in response to deteriorating social and economic conditions in the neighborhood. The population of the 116-city block cache area known as Crown Heights is comprised of persons of many cultures and includes new immigrants. According to the 1990 census, incomes tend to be low - often below poverty levels. Housing is mostly old (circa 1900 - 1930) and at a premium. CHJCC administers programs, advocates for clients, and provides referrals on issues of housing, employment, economic development, entitlements, problems of the aging, aid to crime victims, assistance for indigent residents. CHJCC has created multi-racial, faith, and community-based programs such as Project Care, which unites civic and religious leaders from every segment of the community in a funded program to promote efforts in social and economic development. Creative initiatives such as Project Care have addressed areas of common concern, and new avenues of communication and cooperation have emerged. One of the major goals of the CHJCC is to promote an atmosphere of understanding and cooperation in the community. Areas of common concern, including housing, poverty, crime, employment, education and economic development, are being addressed through new programs.",

        "description": "CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities (also known as Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence) was founded by Asian women in 1986 as one of the first organizations in the United States to mobilize Asian communities to counter anti-Asian violence. CAAAV focuses on institutional violence that affects immigrant working-class communities such as worker exploitation, concentrated urban poverty, police brutality, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) detention and deportation, and criminalization of workers and youth. By organizing across diverse, low-wage and poor Asian communities in New York City, CAAAV exposes and struggles against violence with the goal of building community capacity to exercise self-determination. Building coalitions enables CAAAV to contribute to a unified strategy for a broader, multi-racial and multi-issue movement for social change. CAAAV is a volunteer-driven organization led by members of low-income Asian immigrant communities.",

These basic resources - food, health insurance, child care and tax refunds - increase the likelihood that families are healthy and stable, with parents who work and children who attend school.\r\n\r\nSingleStop USA is the ambitious nationwide expansion of SingleStop NY, a remarkably successful program launched by the Robin Hood Foundation to connect the working poor in New York with government funds and services intended for them.\r\n\r\nIncorporated as a non-profit in March, 2007, SingleStop USA encompasses the existing New York program, as well new efforts throughout the country. In its first five years, SingleStop USA will deliver $2 billion in benefits to up to a million households.\r\n\r\nThese efforts change the way America combats poverty by focusing on prevention rather than intervention. Benefits provide a cushion against the small setbacks - a sick child, car trouble, temporary job loss - that can become catastrophes in the lives of the working poor.",
